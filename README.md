# E-commerce Product Page Documentation

![Design preview for the E-commerce product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This project is my solution for the E-commerce Product Page challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a responsive product page for an e-commerce website.

## Overview

The E-commerce Product Page challenge focused on building a visually appealing and functional product page for an e-commerce website. The goal was to create a design that showcases a product with its details, images, pricing, and related products.

I implemented the project using HTML, CSS (with SCSS), and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive product page. The objective was to provide users with an immersive experience, enabling them to explore the product's features, view different product images, and add the item to their cart.

The JavaScript logic handled the dynamic rendering of product images, product details, and the addition of the item to the cart. The SCSS styles were used to create a modular and maintainable CSS codebase, enabling easy customization and extension.
